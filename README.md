## Installation

I have made two viewing methods available: 

- static (html web pages)
- interactive (iPython notebooks)

For a **static view**, no set up is needed--you can simply clone this locally and render each html file in your browser.


For an **interactive experience**, you will need to set up the following locally (instructions below). _Note: the third req is for C# notebooks only._

- Jupyter Lab
- python3, dotnet-interactive language kernels 
- sql server (dockerized if using MacOS) & copy of internal database for Jira Align.



### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/zrizvi93/analysis-notebooks.git`

### Setup

- For a more interactive experience, please set up Jupyter Lab (instructions coming soon):
